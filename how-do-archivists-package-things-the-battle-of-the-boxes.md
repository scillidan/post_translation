# [How do archivists package things? The battle of the boxes](https://peelarchivesblog.com/2024/09/10/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes/)

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_01.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240409_093520-3819877179-e1725479157965.jpg)

It’s been a while since we posted one of our articles pulling back the curtains on archival work. To make up for that, here’s a special edition of our popular [Archives FAQs and Facts](https://peelarchivesblog.com/category/archives-faqs-and-facts/) series. For the first time, we’ll compare how archivists in two countries do things a little differently to achieve a common goal.

We’ll show you how archivists package (or “house”) the most common types of physical documents for long-term storage. That is, we’ll talk *boxes* and *files*. And we’ll benefit from the experience of special contributors from the United Kingdom to compare how archivists in Canada and the UK commonly do their packaging.

To make the comparison easier, we’ll even coin some technical terms that may spark discussions among archives fans and followers.

This post came about for a few reasons:

- **Stereotype busting**: Fictional archives are often a far cry from reality, leading to misunderstandings when new users approach real archives.

- **Public curiosity**: Individuals and organizations often contact archivists and conservators (experts on repairing and stabilizing physical media) for advice about properly packaging their own valuable records. Perhaps some of our practices, revealed here, can be adapted for home and office use.

- **Professional curiosity**: I (Samantha at the Region of Peel Archives) have long noticed some intriguing differences in packaging practices between archives in the UK and North America. The comparison is a great way to showcase basic preservation measures.

(Courtesy of a [twitter thread](https://x.com/NCArchives/status/1682055889220694016) by the State Archives of North Carolina.)*

Why is this post called the “*battle* of the boxes”? First, this is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the friendly rivalry between the two common packaging styles we’ll look at. Archivists themselves sometimes take their local practices for granted. We hope that archival workers, as well as interested members of the public, might learn something about one another.

Second, and more seriously, archivists wage war every day against the universe’s tendency to disorder. Boxes and files are just some of the weapons in our arsenal, as we strive to keep the self-knowledge of humanity safe for as long as possible.

It’s only fitting, then, to begin by thanking the members of the worldwide community of preservationists who helped me with this post. I’m particularly grateful to Lizzy Baker and Rachel Gill (Archives Lead and Archivist respectively at the [Tyne & Wear Archives](https://twarchives.org.uk/) in Newcastle, UK) and Shirley Jones (Head of Conservation at the [West Yorkshire Archive Service](https://www.wyjs.org.uk/archive-service/), Wakefield, UK) for sharing their experience.

Thank you also to Penelope Bertrand and Elise Rowsome, collection managers at [Library and Archives Canada](https://library-archives.canada.ca/eng/), and Professor Don Spanner at Western University for helpful conversations.

## Archival scenery and stereotypes

Our exploration of archival packaging begins with popping a pervasive stereotype. In fact, this balloon of expectation rapidly deflates for anyone visiting archival storage for the first time.

Archives in movies and TV often have a certain *look*: a jumble of odd-sized papers and books (mostly books), crammed on shelves and tables. This stuff looks varied and intriguing. (It’s much easier for stuff to look intriguing when it’s exposed.)

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_03.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/movies-packaging.jpg)  
*Scenes from the films* The Ring *and* Nostradamus. *Horror comes in many forms.*

Of course, real archival shelves do host traditionally vintage-looking items, especially large tomes. (These shelves are frequently employed as photo op backdrops when archives appear in the news.) But the archivist’s guilty secret is that most stocked archival shelves look comparatively bland: row on row of identical boxes, filled with identical files, and cryptically labelled.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_04.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/shelves.jpg)

Why would regularly sized boxes and files be the norm, especially if archival records run the gamut from maps, postcards, and reports, to letters, handbills, and photographs? In a way this question has answered itself, but let’s unpack it – pun intended.

## Some “handy” terminology

The first thing that often surprises people is that archivists overwhelmingly use paper or cardboard packaging.

Paper containers are lightweight and breathable. (Trapped stagnant environments are attractive to pests and mould). Archival containers are specially treated to be acid-free. They may also contain a buffering agent that helps neutralize incoming acid from old documents. Low-acid packaging considerably slows the breakdown of naturally acidic records, especially in the controlled climate of archival vaults. For all these reasons (and more), archivists don’t put records and photos in ring-binders or albums.

In this post, we’ll concentrate on the **_most common sizes and combinations_** of archival boxes and files. We’re going to refer to these containers as **_standard packaging_**.

In this common archival packaging method, records are placed in standard archival files which are then packed in standard archival boxes. In fact, archival boxes and files are so very standard that archives users instantly spot them when they occasionally appear in the media.

One of the key advantages of standard packaging is that it universally accommodates a particular range of common document sizes. For convenience, we’ll call this range **_hand-scale documents_**: documents that can be held comfortably between our hands held not too far apart. This range of sizes arguably encompasses the majority of paper and photographic records produced in daily life over the centuries, both before and after paper sizes were standardized.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_05.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hand-scale-documents-examples.jpg)

*Files of hand-scale documents at the Region of Peel Archives.* From top left clockwise: *early 19th century, mid-late 19th century, late 20th twentieth century, early 20th century*.

## The benefits of uniformity

The aim of standard packaging is to enclose groups of records – in this case, hand-scale documents of variable sizes – in smaller packages (files) housed in larger packages (boxes).

Why? It’s easier to *control* records packed up this way. And for archivists dealing with lots of rare or evidential records, control means stability, and stability means accessibility over the long term. After all, in the world of archives, “long-term” means hundreds of years, and “lots” means thousands of boxes containing millions of individual records.

```md
**How standard packaging maximizes control**

**_Preservation control_**:

**Separating** large volumes of documents into small groups (like files) minimizes overcrowding and damage from creasing and curvature.

**Shielding** documents protects them from dust, fading, errant mould spores, and modest amounts of liquid, like the blood, sweat, and tears of archivists.

**Stabilizing** documents reduces damage from unnecessary movement, shifting, and handling. Same-sized items stored next to one another (including boxes) are generally more stable than oddly sized items.

**_Administrative control_**:

**Storing** boxes efficiently maximizes our use of shelf space. Archivists are always chasing ways to optimize every costly square centimeter of real estate, and standard packaging wastes the least amount.

**Locating** boxes on kilometres of shelving is easier if the boxes can be assigned precise, documented positions. Compact sequentially shelved boxes are documented more readily than jumbled formless piles.

**Manufacturing** standard-sized boxes and folders is more efficient for vendors. This means better prices for archivists, since archival-quality packaging is already expensive. (To stabilize particularly fragile or oddly shaped records, conservators sometimes design and construct custom-fitted containers.)

**_Intellectual control_**:

**Understanding** archival records requires structure. Archivists [analyze and organize](https://peelarchivesblog.com/2015/08/26/how-do-archivists-organize-collections/) records, and then synthesize structured overviews called [archival descriptions or finding aids](https://peelarchivesblog.com/2016/02/29/how-do-archivists-describe-collections-or-how-to-read-a-finding-aid/). Physical packaging is linked to these descriptions so that people know what they’re looking at. For example, a physical folder of records will correspond to a “file” in an archival description.

**Labelling** records is easier with regular, clean packaging. File labels link records to their descriptions.
```

## How we do it

What does all this actually look like on the inside? We’re going to show you, and from two different perspectives. We’ll demonstrate how standard packaging works in   

- **Canada**, representing North America
- The **UK**, also representing some European countries

As we’ll see, there is one major difference between the two styles. We’ll dub the North American style **vertical** **standard packaging** and the UK style **horizontal** **(flat) standard packaging**. I have found that verticalist and horizontalist practitioners feel strongly about the strengths of their own style. It will be interesting to see if this blog post generates any discussion, heated or otherwise. And of course there are a variety of exceptions to what follows. (We’ll return to those at the end of this post.)

**So, let’s look at each style with respect to two major categories**:

1.  Basic supplies: the physical containers we rely on
2.  Basic configuration: how we use those supplies properly

## CANADA: VERTICAL standard packaging

The following shows how we do common packaging at the Region of Peel Archives.

This style tends to be fairly standard across North America, down to the physical dimensions of our supplies. (Just to make sure of this, I reached out to several Canadian experts who corroborated my sense that this packaging style is indeed routine across the continent.)

## A. Basic supplies

Standard packaging in North America relies on two basic physical containers: the **file folder** and the **box**. These supplies are supplemented by various **enclosures and separators** for use within files.

The classic North American **archival folder** (also called a file or a file folder) is a folded piece of acid-free card. The open edge of the file sports a tab or raised edge on which we write information about the file contents, keyed to the [archival description](https://peelarchivesblog.com/2016/02/29/how-do-archivists-describe-collections-or-how-to-read-a-finding-aid/).

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_06.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/file-folder.jpg)  
*The typical North American archival file folder.*

**Boxes** for hand-scale documents generally come in two main styles:

**The Hollinger** **Box**: In the North American archives world, the Hollinger Box is iconic. The term *Hollinger* is to boxes as *Kleenex* is to tissues: used for any narrow upright file box, even ones not actually made by the Hollinger company. These smaller filing boxes are lighter to carry and easier to store.

**The Bankers Box**: A commonly used larger box is the classic “Bankers Box.” This size of box is typically used in records centres of large organizations. An acid-free version is used for modern administrative records in archives. This box can be, let’s say, taxing on staff in the large volumes in which it tends to accumulate.  

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_07.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/archival-boxes.jpg)

*Typical North American archival boxes including (from the left) a Bankers box, a Hollinger box, and a half-Bankers box, a new favourite of the Region of Peel Archives. Some brands have removable lids while others have hinged lids.*

```md
**Like a glove**

It’s worth pointing out the close fit between the North American file and box. The two supplies are complementary, based on dimensions that evolved with record keeping itself.

In organizational office cultures, paper sizes were [standardized differently in North America than in the rest of the world.](https://archive.org/details/DunnA.D.NotesOnTheStandardizationOfPaperSizes) In North America, two popular sizes of hand-scale paper exist: “letter-size” paper (8.5 X 11 inches) and “legal-size” paper (8.5 X 14 inches).

At the Region of Peel Archives (and in many other North America archives) we predominantly use the larger **legal-size folders** designed to accommodate legal-size paper, along with boxes designed to accommodate both. Both Hollinger and Bankers boxes come in lengths constructed for legal-size files.

Naturally, many of our records predate this standard sizing; but we find that legal-size folders and boxes accommodate the majority of hand-scale documents created over many centuries. This includes all the examples of hand-scale documents depicted above.
```

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_08.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20230901_115001.jpg)

Last on our list of basic supplies are a variety of **enclosures** that we use *within* files to help further stabilize documents.

Enclosures, such as paper or [archivally acceptable plastic](https://postalmuseum.si.edu/choosing-safe-plastics) sleeves, tend to have at least one open edge. This reduces the level at which the record will stew in its own juices (in a “microclimate”) without exposure to air circulation.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_09.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240411_131116-1-1241821945-e1725382689365.jpg)  
*Some examples of enclosures and sleeves, both paper and archival plastic.*

## B. Basic configuration

Now let’s look at how these supplies work together.

As we’ve already hinted, at the Region of Peel Archives, as in most of North America, we package hand-scale files **vertically** in boxes. Files are held in place by the files on either side of them.  

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_10.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20230831_151222-679877836-e1725388304768.jpg)  
*A Hollinger box of records at the Region of Peel Archives.*

To protect documents filed this way, we need to package them properly. Here are some guidelines we observe.

## Packing files ready for boxes

**File folders should not be overfilled and should be adjusted appropriately**. File folders should be manually squared off at the bottom to accommodate the thickness of the records within them. North American file folders generally come with an array of pre-scored lines for this purpose.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_11.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/good-and-bad-files.png)

Left and centre: *Correctly foldering a thick file of modern office paper, and a slim file of 19th century documents.* Right: *Incorrectly foldering some 19th century deeds.*

## Packing files into boxes

**Boxes should be filled snuggly with files, but not overfilled**. Both overfilling and underfilling a box could cause damage like folding or curvature. Archivists test the ideal fit by eye, as well as by ease of access to files, and ability to fit an average hand down the back of a filled box.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_12.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20230815_140623.jpg)

_A vertically filled box seen from above. This box includes file folders containing documents of varying sizes, and also an unpublished bound volume (book). When bound volumes are stored in boxes, we make sure their spines are facing downwards so that the weight of the text block (the pages) does not pull away from the spine._

**Any space left in a partially filled box needs to be braced** so that files don’t slump over. Slumping and curvature are the primary risks of this packaging style. Some archivists tip the box on its side while filling it, and ask archives researchers to do the same when removing files for use.

```md
**Filling the gap**

At the Region of Peel Archives, we have invented our own way of filling gaps in boxes with an accordioned piece of polyethylene foam (Ethafoam) sheeting affectionately known (by us) as a “puff.”

We find that the folded sheeting adjusts itself nicely as the gap is gradually filled with files. This method is more efficient and less wasteful for us than constructing custom-fitted cardboard spacers, especially as we try eventually to use every inch of space in every box.

The “puffs” can be reused many times, unlike custom-made spacers.
```

## Controlling documents inside files

Archival files commonly contain more than one document. There are a couple of reasons for this. Foldering every individual document would add a lot of bulk. More importantly, records are often [closely related to other record](https://peelarchivesblog.com/2015/08/26/how-do-archivists-organize-collections/)s: storing them together as a set maintains and clarifies these conceptual chunks.

Inside files we use a variety of means to stabilize individual documents and protect them from one another. This is where “house style” may vary between North American archival institutions. Below are some ways we use to stabilize documents at the Region of Peel Archives.

**Keeping multipage documents together**. A single document may have multiple parts, such as a multipage report, or letters with envelopes or inserts. To clarify which pages belong together in a file of multipage documents we may use a piece of buffered acid-free paper as a thin sub-folder for each. Generally speaking, we try to associate pages without altering or damaging them.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_14.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20230831_145510-1525188161-e1725401097809.jpg)  
*The pages of this document are kept together inside a file by using a folded piece of bond paper.*

Of course, some documents come to us clipped together with staples or paperclips. These are removed if corroded, but archivists decide whether to remove *all* non-archival clips on a case-by-case basis. (Whether and how to replace them with archival paperclips is [controversial](https://balliolarchivist.wordpress.com/tag/paper-clips/) even among archivists!)

**Stabilizing fragile records**. A particularly fragile document may be placed in an enclosure, such as a polyester sleeve. (Again, only some plastics are suitable for archival use.) This sleeve allows researchers to view and handle the record safely. Similarly, photographic records like slides, negatives, and photographs may require extra protection to ensure the photographic emulsion (image layer) is not damaged. We may also use acid-free tissue paper to protect photographs or other easily scratched surfaces.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_15.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fragile-records.jpg)  
Left: *Photographs interleaved with archival tissue paper to protect image surfaces.* Right: *A fragile 19th-century letter protected by a Mylar sleeve and backed by a stiff piece of card.*

**Stabilizing small records**. Small records like tiny cards and notes, or photographic slides, can shift around and be overlooked more easily within standard files, particularly when housed with larger associated records (think of snapshots enclosed in a letter). We may put smaller items in sleeves to bring them closer to standard document sizes.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_16.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/small-records.jpg)  
*Small photographs and slides are inserted into paper or polypropylene sleeves to stabilize and keep them in order within larger files. (Large collections of same-sized photographs may be stored in other ways.)*

## Packing boxes on shelves

Both Hollinger and Bankers boxes are shelved in a single layer on shelves specially designed for their height. As boxes aren’t piled on top of on another, this allows for quick retrieval and return.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_17.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20230901_141744.jpg)  
*Removing a North American archival box from its shelf. Hollinger-style boxes sometimes come with a pullstring or handle to aid retrieval.*

The labelling on boxes gives no detailed information about the records within. Rather an identification code links the box to information about its contents and allows archivists to find the box on kilometres of shelving.

## UNITED KINGDOM: HORIZONTAL (FLAT) standard packaging

The following is my synthesis of common UK practice, based on chats and visits with UK archivists over the years. Most recently, Lizzy, Rachel, and Shirley (mentioned in the introduction) have been my primary informants. Many thanks to all three for the accompanying photographs.

Photographs from both their practices are included: in the UK, box and file dimensions vary more considerably between archival institutions than they do in North America.

## A. Basic supplies

Archivists in the UK also rely on boxes and folders for basic archival packaging of hand-scale documents. However, the exact dimensions of these supplies are not as interrelated or universal as in North America.  Rather, archives order boxes that work with their shelving or document types. Then an archivist or conservator will buy or make folders to fit within the footprint of their boxes.  

**Files** are physically constructed in a variety of ways. Sometimes archivists use folders made of acid-free card. These are somewhat similar to standard North American file folders, but unlike the latter, they generally include flaps which enclose records or two or more sides. For thinner sets of records, archivists may use large acid-free envelopes as a file. In lieu of a file folder, they may also wrap sets of records in acid-free paper or tissue.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_18.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/uk-folders.jpg)

**Boxes** for documents in the UK tend to be shallow, with removeable lids.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_19.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/uk-boxes.jpg)

**Other UK supplies**:

As we’ll see shortly, in the UK **cotton tape** is widely used to tie each file shut. And, as in North America, archivists use various ways of stabilizing and associating records within files, including sleeves and paperclips.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_20.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/uk-supplies.jpg)

## B. Basic configuration

Most archivists in the UK store hand-scale document files flat, by stacking them in shallow boxes.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_21.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/box-and-contents-2-723930952-e1725406716807.jpg)  
*A filled box at the Tyne & Wear Archives showing two ways of packaging files, in folders and in large envelopes (see below)._ (_Courtesy of the Tyne & Wear Archives.)*

## Packing files ready for boxes

In UK document boxes, files are commonly tied shut with archival tape made of cotton or linen. The knot or bow is placed to the side of the file. The archival citation is printed on the file so that the file can be identified and retrieved.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_22.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/tied-folder-out-of-box-3750063843-e1725407004929.jpeg)  
*Closed and tied four-flap folder at the West Yorkshire Archive Service. (Courtesy and copyright of the West Yorkshire Archive Service, Conservation).*

## Packing folders into boxes

Files are laid flat in their boxes, one on top of the next, until the box is full.

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_23.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/filling-uk-boxes.jpg)  
Left: *Stack of thicker tied folders ready for stacking into their box. (Courtesy and copyright of West Yorkshire Archive Service.)* Right: *Loaded box of stacked files. (Courtesy and copyright of The John Goodchild Archive and Antiquarian Collection, West Yorkshire Archive Service, Wakefield.)*

For this orientation to work, files must be packaged correctly.

- **Folders should not be overfilled** past their capacity, to avoid curvature of records.
- **The edges of records should be well clear** of the edges of the folder before folding the flaps.
- **The knot of the archival tape should be tied to the side** so that a file on top doesn’t experience a pressure point from a knot on the file beneath it.
- **Files should be stacked for maximum stability** and protection: for instance, archivists place heavier, thicker, or broader files near the bottom of the stack to avoid damage to lighter, smaller packages.
- **Boxes should be filled to the top** so that the box lid does not buckle inwards from the weight of boxes placed on top of it.  

## Controlling records inside files

As in North America, UK archives each have their own in-house preferences for controlling documents within files. The range of practices on both sides of the pond are very similar.

That said, one uniquely British way of controlling documents within files includes the use of the “treasury tag,” particularly for modern government files. The treasury tag is piece of cord with wide ends. Holes are punched through one corner of a stack of related papers or enclosures, and the cord loosely passed through them. The tag ensures that papers from a file can’t become disassociated while being used. You can learn more about how tags are applied in [guidance](https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/paper-files-preparation-guidance.pdf) from the UK’s National Archives. (Not all UK archives apply new tags, but many will receive records that have been tagged before reaching the archives.)

## Storing boxes on shelves

Flat storage boxes in the UK are stacked one on top of the other within the limits of shelf depth and the pressure from accumulated weight.

## Face-off: advantages and disadvantages

Over the years, I’ve met archivists from both sides of the Atlantic who were initially surprised by one another’s packaging style. The generous professionals I spoke with for this post have risen to the challenge of direct comparison. Below is our collective sense of the relative strengths and weaknesses of our differing styles. We agree that both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and that both work as long as guidelines are observed.

## Vertical packaging

**Advantages:**

[![](https://scillidan.github.io/image_post/how-do-archivists-package-things-the-battle-of-the-boxes_26.webp)](https://peelarchivesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20230418_113608.jpg)

- Documents are gently suspended and don’t move around very much even if the box is jostled.
- The only edge of a document touching its file (the bottom edge) is protected from damage or folding by this sandwiching of the entire document.
- Records are free from the weight of other records being stored on top of them.
- Stacks of larger items do not curve around stacks of smaller items. (Curvature of larger items around other items can be a problem with items stored on top of each other.)
- One file can be easily removed without having to rummage through a pile, cutting down on handling.
- Boxes are not weighed down by other boxes on top of them.
- One box can be removed from a shelf without removing other boxes, again cutting down on handling.
- By reading the top file tabs you can see at a glance what the box contains.
- The open-at-the-top file allows for healthy air circulation.
- Packaging, retrieving, and replacing documents, files, and boxes is relatively quick.

**Disadvantages**:

- Improperly filled files and boxes can cause curvature and damaged edges.
- Contents of files can spill out if a box is dropped or tipped and the lid comes off.
- When boxes are being filed, or when files are removed for use, the remaining files can slump.

## Horizontal (flat) packaging

**Advantages**

- Flat storage ensures gravity is acting on documents equally at all points. This helps protect documents from problems with slumping and curvature.
- As long as documents and boxes are not overweighted, horizontal storage helps to flatten and immobilize documents.
- Folders that completely encase documents and are tied shut offer the maximum protection from dust and light, and from being dropped and scattered.
- Folders of varying dimensions can be stacked in a single box.

**Disadvantages**

- Sometimes multiple folders need to be removed from boxes to search for and remove a particular folder. This does increase overall handling of records.
- Sometimes boxes may need to be moved to access other boxes below them.  
- Archives researchers don’t always retie tape appropriately, so archivists need to monitor tying.  
- Tape that is too tight or improperly tied can cause notching in the sides of records or files.
- Packaging, retrieving, and replacing documents and their containers can be a little more time-consuming.

## Wrapping up

Interestingly, the horizontal versus vertical division we’ve looked at is echoed in archives around the world. Glimpses of archival storage on social media posts suggest that across Europe, for example, both methods are followed.   

What is the basis for what seems a big difference (to archivists anyway)? The answer likely lies in the emphasis on vertical storage in the US after the invention of the filing cabinet in the late 19th century – and the fact that many North American archives put down formal roots after this time. Media historian [Craig Robertson](https://camd.northeastern.edu/people/craig-robertson/#:~:text=Craig%20Robertson%20is%20a%20media,storage%20and%20circulation%20of%20information.) has written a fascinating [article](https://placesjournal.org/article/the-filing-cabinet-and-20th-century-information-infrastructure/) and now a [book](https://www.upress.umn.edu/9781517909468/the-filing-cabinet/) on vertical storage and its role in office culture for those who wish to pursue a direct link to the archival [Hollinger box](https://www.hollingermetaledge.com/our-history/#:~:text=Hollinger%20Metal%20Edge%20was%20founded,of%20valuable%20documents%20and%20photographs.).

Aside from habits rooted in history, our preferences may be philosophical and aesthetic. British conservator Sheila Jones muses that there is a sense in which flat storage visually symbolizes a shift in status. Horizontal storage, she suggested in our conversation, gives us a sense that archival records are special: their active “work is done, and they may now lie down in their boxes” safely and behind the scenes.

Perhaps, in the end, we should focus on the ultimate goal of preservation. In that spirit, we return to some commonalities. Here are some caveats all our archivists wanted you to know.

First, our packaging methods do overlap. For instance, the Region of Peel Archives routinely stores records in flat shallow boxes if those records are larger than our legal-size folders. We’ll even wrap certain types of records in acid-free paper, and tie wrappers shut with linen tape!

And in the UK, a few archives routinely store some records vertically. An interesting example is the [National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) in the UK, which uses a hybrid method: shallow boxes are loaded flat, and then tied up with tape and turned on their sides in storage.

Second and relatedly, remember that our show-and-tell above applies to one *very common range of sizes and types of records*, that is, hand-scale documents. Most institutional archives collect records that fall outside this range. Indeed, the sheer variety and fragility of the world’s documentary heritage means archivists and conservators must show considerable ingenuity and skill in storing it safely. This blog post has not been able to cover a host of packaging challenges, including audiovisual and digital records (those are, as they say, another story).  Below you’ll find a slideshow gallery of other packaging configurations.  

Finally, what we’ve represented above is an ideal. The volume of valuable records increases exponentially and relentlessly year by year, at pace with the human activity that produces it. Archivists and conservators often need to triage repackaging: they must balance availability for public access against packaging perfection. For example, sometimes archivists must decide if the original containers in which files arrive might suffice for the short or the long term. In such cases, we will remove the most destructive elements of original packaging – such as plastics that eventually turn to gluey slime, or rusting paperclips – while retaining relatively stable original containers.

Archival work is, if nothing else, a compromise with reality. While we can’t halt time, we can slow down its effects using the humble ammunition of packaging.

## Bonus gallery of packaging picks

We conclude with a casual stroll through archival packaging examples from both the UK and Canada that go beyond what we’ve explored above. (We feel morally obligated to point out that all boxes depicted below have lids, even when not shown!) We hope this slideshow demonstrates our unity of purpose and practice on both sides of the Atlantic.

A photograph album in a flat box at the Region of Peel Archives. Highly acidic albums and scrapbooks are a challenge if photos and other documents are glued into them, or pages feature important annotations. Often the best we can do is store the album as is, perhaps interleaving pages with acid-free tissue.
