# [8 Stretches to Do Before Bed](https://www.healthline.com/health/stretching-before-bed)

Among [natural sleep remedies](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/natural-sleep-aids) — from drinking chamomile tea to diffusing essential oils — stretching is often overlooked. But this simple act may help you fall asleep faster and improve the quality of your sleep.

A [2016 review of studies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2015.12.001) found a link between meditative movements (such as [tai chi](https://www.healthline.com/health/tai-chi-benefits) and [yoga](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercises/definitive-guide-to-yoga)) and improved sleep quality. This improved sleep quality was further linked to a better quality of life.

But why does stretching have this effect on sleep? It’s likely a mix of things.

For one, getting in touch with your body by stretching helps to focus your attention on your breath and body, not the stressors of the day. This awareness of your body helps you develop [mindfulness](https://www.healthline.com/health/mindfulness-tricks-to-reduce-anxiety), which has been [shownTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4407465/) to help promote better sleep.

Stretching also offers potential physical benefits, helping to relieve muscle tension and prevent sleep-disrupting cramps. Just make sure to stick to gentle stretches — doing a big workout before bed can have the opposite effect.

Here are eight stretches to add to your nightly routine.

## 1\. Bear hug

This stretch works the [rhomboids](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/rhomboid-major-muscle) and [trapezius](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/trapezius-muscle) muscles of your upper back. It helps to alleviate shoulder blade discomfort or pain that’s caused by poor posture, bursitis, or [frozen shoulder](https://www.healthline.com/health/frozen-shoulder).
