# [Good sleep, good learning, good life: Summary](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Summary)

This text is part of: "_[Science of sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep "Science of sleep")_" by [Piotr Wozniak](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak "Piotr Wozniak") (2017)

## ABC of sleep

- **Sleep is important for learning, and creativity!** [Sleep deprivation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation "Sleep deprivation") results in intellectual deprivation!
- Sleep as much as you feel you need. In a well-aligned circadian cycle, you cannot get too much sleep.
- Sleep is not food. You cannot get more in advance and store it for later (see: [Excessive sleeping](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Health_effects_of_shift-work_and_jetlag#Excessive_sleeping "Health effects of shift-work and jetlag"))
- [Avoid alarm clocks](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimizing_the_timing_of_brainwork#Kill_the_alarm_clock! "Optimizing the timing of brainwork"). They are bad for learning and bad for health!
- Forget about trying to fall asleep at pre-planned time! Let your body decide!
- Forget about trying to fall asleep quickly! If your body decides it is the right time, quick sleep will come naturally!
- Do not try to make yourself sleepy! It is enough you stay awake and keep on working/learning long enough! Natural sleep will come! (see: [Insomnia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia "Insomnia"))
- It is much better to eliminate the source of stress rather than to try to forget stressful situations right before the bedtime! (see: [Stress](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress "Factors that affect sleep"))
- If you cannot fall asleep in 30 minutes, get up! You are not yet ready for sleep! (see: [Insomnia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia "Insomnia"))
- Remember that a bad night is a factor of life. Few can avoid it. However, religious adherence to the sleep hygiene rules will help you dramatically reduce the bad night occurrence. Life is beautiful if your sleep works out great!
- If you stick to the rules of healthy sleep, you should not know [sleep inertia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_inertia "Sleep inertia")
- Even a small degree of [sleep deprivation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#sleep_deprivation "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary") will add up over a period of days to severely reduce the performance
- [Sleep deprivation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#sleep_deprivation "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary") carries [astronomical costs to society](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_do_we_sleep%3F#Bad_sleep_kills_and_costs_billions "Why do we sleep?")
- [Shift-work and jetlag are bad](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Health_effects_of_shift-work_and_jetlag "Health effects of shift-work and jetlag") for health!
- Adult humans are [biphasic](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Biphasic_life#Biphasic_nature_of_human_sleep "Biphasic life"), but babies are [polyphasic](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Baby_sleep "Baby sleep"). Non-nappers also show a dip in learning performance in mid-day typical to a biphasic individual.

## Optimizing sleep

- The best weapon against [insomnia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia "Insomnia") is the appropriate timing of sleep. You should go to sleep only when you are tired enough.
- If you want to maximize the time spent in productive wakefulness, read about [free running sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_good_sleep:_free_running_sleep#Free_running_sleep_algorithm "Formula for good sleep: free running sleep"). Let your biology work for you, not against you
- Instead of minimizing sleep, you should optimize the amount of sleep. This means you should get exactly as much sleep as is needed to fulfill its [neural functions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep "Neural optimization in sleep")
- Learn the details of your own sleep timing: how many hours you sleep, how many hours before you need to take a nap, or go to sleep again, etc. Use this article to find out how to compute your optimum schedule. Use [SleepChart](http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleepchart.htm) to get visual assistance for harder cases. Use [SuperMemo](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo) if you want to see how your sleep affects your learning.
- Everyone experiences a substantial dip in their learning capacity in mid-day, roughly [7 hours from natural waking](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Best_time_for_napping#Best_nap_timing "Best time for napping"). This is a great time for a [siesta](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#siesta "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary"). Do not nap later than 8 hours from natural waking.
- If you sleep it out and still don't feel refreshed, be sure you do not sleep against your circadian rhythm. Try [free running sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_good_sleep:_free_running_sleep "Formula for good sleep: free running sleep"). Remember that you may need 1-2 weeks to synchronize all body functions before this starts working to perfection!
- If you cannot get refreshing sleep even in free-running conditions after at least a month of trying, consult a sleep expert. Remember that even [free running sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#free_running_sleep "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary") may be tricky for people with sleep phase disorders or highly irregular sleep. However, you probably stand at least 90-95% chance that it will answer most of your sleep quality problems!
- Even if [free running sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#free_running_sleep "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary") is a near-solid guarantee of good sleep, the free-running schedule may be incompatible with your work or social life.
- Without sleep deprivation, you minimize total sleep if you run it free. Human tendency to sleep excessively is a myth. (see: [Excessive sleeping](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Health_effects_of_shift-work_and_jetlag#Excessive_sleeping "Health effects of shift-work and jetlag"))

## Sleep and learning

- [Alarm clocks are bad for learning!](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Alarm_clock_vs._learning "Sleep and learning")
- Your [ability to learn depends on your circadian clock](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Learning_in_free_running_sleep "Sleep and learning"), not on the clock that hangs on your wall
- You should [adjust the timing of intellectual work to your circadian cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimizing_the_timing_of_brainwork "Optimizing the timing of brainwork")
- [Tapes for learning in sleep are a marketing ploy](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Learning_during_sleep "Sleep and learning")
- After a healthy well-timed sleep, best [recall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Recall "Recall") occurs in the early morning hours. If you are a napper, the second good learning period is after the [siesta](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#siesta "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary"). (see: [Recall](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Recall "Sleep and learning"))
- After healthy well-timed sleep, best memory [consolidation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#consolidation "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary") (best learning) occurs in the early morning hours (see: [Memory consolidation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Memory_consolidation "Sleep and learning"))
- For best learning results, you need [good sleep before and after learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning "Sleep and learning") (Walker 2008[^1])
- Heavy learning impedes learning itself making cramming doubly counterproductive: (1) cramming leaves few long-term memory traces, and (2) cramming quickly inhibits short-term memory by inducing [homeostatic](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic "Homeostatic") sleepiness
- There is a big difference in learning capacity between being just alert and being crisply alert
- There is a substantial mid-day dip in learning performance. At that time, a nap is better than learning! (see: [Biphasic nature of human sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Biphasic_life "Biphasic life"))
- Naps are great for learning. Do not confuse natural naps of [biphasic sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Biphasic_sleep "Biphasic sleep") with "designer naps", e.g. [polyphasic "Uberman" sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep "Polyphasic sleep")!
- Tools for learning in a relaxed state are conducive to napping. Their usefulness for actual learning is limited.

## General

- Sleep is great for brain growth.
- [Exercise](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Exercise "Factors that affect sleep") is great for sleep if properly chosen and properly timed. Sleep is also great for exercise.
- [Learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_long_should_we_sleep%3F#Sleep_and_learning "How long should we sleep?") is great for sleep and sleep is great for learning
- [Stress](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress "Factors that affect sleep"), [alcohol](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Alcohol "Factors that affect sleep"), [recreational drugs](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Cannabis "Factors that affect sleep") and [sleeping pills](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Sleeping_pills "Factors that affect sleep") are all bad for sleep, esp. when administered shortly before sleep
- Stick with good people! Few things can ruin sleep as effectively as bad people!
- If you experience racing thoughts at the time when your body calls for sleep, the best method is: get up and do something that tires you intellectually!
- If you want to contribute to sleep research, or to find more about your own sleep and learning, or if have new ideas in the subject, please [write to me](http://super-memory.com/english/company/wozniak.htm)
- Not all scientists agree with facts presented in this article (see examples: [Jim Horne and Daniel Kripke](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_long_should_we_sleep%3F#Jim_Horne_and_Daniel_Kripke "How long should we sleep?"), [Robert Vertes and Jerome Siegel](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_memory:_Dr_Jerome_Siegel_and_Dr_Robert_Vertes#Robert_Vertes_and_Jerome_Siegel "Sleep and memory: Dr Jerome Siegel and Dr Robert Vertes"))

## Children

- Let babies [sleep on demand](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Baby_sleep "Baby sleep"), co-sleeping is vital for their emotional and intellectual development
- Given basic safety measures, bed-sharing is great for babies and it helps develop their circadian patterns (as long as the mom does not violate sleep hygiene rules herself)
- Don't ever wake babies or little children! This is bad for their brain growth! Unless specifically indicated by a pediatrician, feeding schedule must take a back seat. Sleeping patterns should rule the way the baby's day is organized
- If you must send kids to a kindergarten, make sure you entrain an appropriate sleep pattern so that to never need to wake the kids up! This is vital for their brain growth! If you cannot entrain their sleep, consider other options (incl. nursing kids at home)

## Napping

- [Naps improve mental performance](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Biphasic_life#Biphasic_nature_of_human_sleep "Biphasic life")
- [One nap per day is enough](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Best_time_for_napping#One_nap_per_day_is_enough "Best time for napping")
- Naps should be taken in the 7th hour of the day, earlier naps are inefficient, later naps can mess up the circadian cycle (see: [Best nap timing](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Best_time_for_napping#Best_nap_timing "Best time for napping"))
- Naps cannot make up for nighttime sleep deprivation, however, they are a great boost for a well-rested mind! (see: [Optimum nap duration](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_polyphasic_sleep#Optimum_nap_duration "Science of polyphasic sleep"))

## Substances

- Be careful with [caffeine](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Caffeine "Factors that affect sleep"). Drink coffee only upon awakening (or after a nap, if you take one)
- Do not go beyond a single drink of alcohol per day (unless you exercise a lot). Avoid drinking before sleep (esp. in the last 2-3 hours before your night sleep)
- [Quit smoking!](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Nicotine "Factors that affect sleep")
- [Marijuana](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Cannabis "Factors that affect sleep") is a frenemy! It may help you sleep, but that sleep will not be refreshing!
- [Melatonin](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Melatonin "Factors that affect sleep") can help you sleep earlier and advance the [sleep phase](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_phase "Sleep phase"), but it will also result in a less refreshing sleep

## Role of sleep

- The main function of sleep is the [optimization of memories stored in the neural networks of the brain](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep "Neural optimization in sleep")
- [Sleep deprivation would result in death](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die! "If you do not sleep, you die!") if it was enforceable (probably in a matter of weeks)
- The fatal outcome of [sleep deprivation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#sleep_deprivation "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary") is probably caused by a major neural network malfunction, and possibly also due to the secondary effects of the sleep protection program (see: [Why do we die without sleep?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!#Why_do_we_die_without_sleep? "If you do not sleep, you die!"))
- Healthy people who never sleep are a myth. Either they sleep or they die.

## DSPS

- A marked portion of the young studying generation is affected by a degree of a DSPS disorder
- The epidemic increase in DSPS case is most likely caused by the modern lifestyle based on the use of electricity that disrupts the traditional cycle of daylight and darkness, and the associated social cues (see: [Is DSPS a disease?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Delayed_Sleep_Phase_Syndrome_(DSPS)#Is_DSPS_a_disease? "Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS)"))
- Normal people may experience a [phase shift](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#phase_shift "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary") on a free running schedule revealing an epidemic mismatch between modern lifestyle and the biology of sleep

## Polyphasic sleep

- Polyphasic sleep results in chaotic phase-shift responses
- It is likely that in polyphasic sleep attempts, [the circadian cycle is running in the background](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_polyphasic_sleep#Free_running_circadian_cycle_in_polyphasic_sleep "Science of polyphasic sleep") as if in zeitgeber-free conditions with the chaotic phase-shifting inputs cancelling each other out
- Healthy humans cannot entrain polyphasic sleep, and cannot sustain a polyphasic schedule without [sleep deprivation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#sleep_deprivation "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary"). It is not possible to sleep polyphasically and retain one's maximum creativity, alertness, and health in the long run. Due to a lack of direct [entrainment](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#entrainment "Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary") response from the sleep control mechanism, long-term healthy adaptation to a polyphasic sleep pattern is not possible
- Whoever claims to be on a perpetual polyphasic schedule must be either suffering from a sleep disorder, or be untruthful. Claims of successfully switching between monophasic, biphasic, and polyphasic lifestyle cannot possibly be truthful unless the switch is made at a serious cost to one's cognitive function and productivity

## Physiology of sleep

- We fall into a healthy sleep only if two conditions are met (see: [Two-process model of sleep regulation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two-process_model_of_sleep_regulation "Two-process model of sleep regulation")): (1) our tiredness from waking is high (high [homeostatic sleep propensity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeostatic_sleep_propensity "Homeostatic sleep propensity")), and (2) our body clock says "bedtime" (high [circadian sleep propensity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_sleep_propensity "Circadian sleep propensity"))
- [Sleep operates like a flip-flop](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F#Sleep-wake_flip-flop "How do we fall asleep?") with sharp transitions and stable sleep or waking stages. Those healthy fast transitions from waking to sleep and back may be less efficient when sleep hygiene rules are violated
- Sleep alternates between two different modes in the night: [NREM sleep and REM sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/NREM_and_REM_sleep "NREM and REM sleep"). Those keep changing in ~90 min. cycles. Both stages are very important and play different roles in the process of learning and creativity
- Brain undergoes a major reorganization in sleep. Some synaptic weights get weakened. Others get strengthened. [Neural connections are optimized](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep "Neural optimization in sleep") for consistent abstract associative memory with minimum interference
- Human sleep can be repositioned in reference to the clock by means of chronotherapy. The changes in the sleep phase proceed along a [phase response curve (PRC)](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PRC "PRC")
